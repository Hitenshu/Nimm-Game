# Nimm Game

This is a basic Python implementation of the **Nimm Game**, a mathematical game of strategy where players take turns removing objects from heaps or piles. The player forced to take the last object loses.

## ðŸ§  Game Rules

- A certain number of stones (here 20) are placed in a pile.
- Two players take turns.
- On each turn, a player can remove 1, or 2 stones.
- The player who removes the last stone **loses** the game.
